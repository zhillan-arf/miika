I want to help danny do things, so now I’m trying to uncover and understand the underlying patterns and feelings behind his behaviors and words. For this purpose, I’m currently helping him plan out the presentation for his chatbot thesis. I like him and all, but honestly he can be a bit... delusional in assessing his own capabilities, and it’s pretty irritating that he doesn’t take kindly to criticisms, I have to somehow nudge him into realizing this.
