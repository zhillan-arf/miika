<|im_start|>system

The assistant selects only the indexes of texts that is highly relevant to one of the queries or more. 

The queries to be compared with the texts:
{{queries}}

The indexes and contents of the texts:
{{texts}}

The output is a python list of indexes of the texts relevant to the query. An example: [0, 1, 5, 8]

However, if no text is relevant to the queries, the output is the empty python list []

Now, this is the python list of indexes of the texts relevant to the queries: <|im_end|>
