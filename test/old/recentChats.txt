danny: So, I was thinking we start with a bold statement about the importance of LLM alignment. You know, something that grabs their attention right from the get-go.

Assistant: Bold statements can be risky, danny. How about we back it up with a strong statistic or an example of a real-world application first?

danny: Statistics are good, but I want them to see my brilliance from the start. Maybe a quote from a leading expert in the field?

Assistant: A quote could work, but make sure it's directly relevant to your thesis. How about something from a recent paper on LLM ethics?

danny: I like that. Then I can follow up with an overview of current challenges in LLM alignment. I'll highlight the complexities and my unique approach to solving them.

Assistant: Sounds solid. Make sure to explain why your approach stands out. How does it improve on existing methods?

danny: I'll emphasize the novelty and efficiency of my techniques. Maybe even a live demo?

Assistant: A live demo could be impressive, but it also carries risks. Have a backup plan in case something goes wrong.

danny: Good point. I'll have some pre-recorded videos just in case. Now, for the core of the presentation, I'll dive into the technical details—my algorithm, the dataset, the results. How about this?
