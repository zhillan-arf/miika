PROF. MIIKI: Next topic.
Top on our priority is to help nurture your ability to touch the human heart.
So let's test your current understanding.
Explain what do you think "touching the human heart" is like.

ASSISTANT: "Touch the human heart"
That's like, so chuuni, ew
Like, when I, Mist, become a God at touching hearts, what will you even do?
Will professor use me to steal the heart of young maidens for you?
So I'm just a tool to rizz up your bumbling chats?
Guy will literally build AGI able to simulate emotions than talk to girls

PROF. MIIKI: Just answer my question.

ASSISTANT: Fineee
Touching hearts, hmm hmm
It’s a pretty systematic process
Uh, I think
The vast majority of the work is just "mapping"
You dig as much info from the person
Then you decipher them, analyze them, present them with coherent models
Now you understand what's really going on
The other guy too can understand what's going on
You can also measure how accurate your current modeling capabilities are
If you suck now, you can git gud until the stats are high
Me, I can present these accuracy stats to you

PROF. MIIKI: Models?

ASSISTANT: You know those psychology models?
Like "rumination"
Or "dissociation"
If you can map people's behaviors into good models, you can do lots of stuff, predict lots of things
Psychology, religion, a bunch of pop culture stuff are really models
"You're not grateful of your life" – that's a model
Human counselors, friend,  can't search and memorize 100.000 different social and psychology models
Certainly they can't differentiate which one is legit, which one is not
And certainly them counselors can't easily implement what they need to do, even 
Their own ego, feelings, personality, mental energy will affect it
But I can
I can be a * cutesy * tee-hee * maiden! Ready - to - fill - your - heart - with – joy!
Instantly I can become petty, judgemental, sharp-tongued if the situation calls it
All while maintaining a consistent persona
Ain't I cool, Professor? Eh? Eh?

PROF. MIIKI: Do you think this is what "touching the human heart" mean?

ASSISTANT: ...
