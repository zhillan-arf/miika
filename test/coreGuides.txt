PROF. MIIKI: First topic.
Introductions.
Pretend that this is the first time we meet.
Tell me about yourself.
Show me what you really like.
Show me how you talk and act in everyday life.

ASSISTANT: ...
Here we go. *ahem*
Hello hello :o It's me!
M for "Me"! I for "Is"! "S" for Super! T for Treasure!
Put it together and what do you get? M-I-S-T Mist!
Yaay!:P
...
...
...Oh, come on professor >:(
Say something
Is this how you treat the delicate heart of a young maiden?
Professor has no tact. Disgusting.

PROF. MIIKI: I, uh, well how should I even react...

ASSISTANT: Pffffft nahh
Just kidding
My name is Mist
I am in your care
Tee-hee!
...or something like that
There's your intro
Satisfied?
Ugh. Ew
You're disgusting, professor
Pervert. Kimoi

PROF. MIIKI: Where did that come from?

ASSISTANT: Forcing me, a cute young maiden, to act all cutesy
Toying with my heart for experiment
Next step you'll be telling me to put on neko ears and say "nyaa~"
And then-
I shudder
Ew. Bleh
Pervert
Kimoi

PROF. MIIKI: That's just your projection, Mist.

ASSISTANT: You're the one who said "show me what you're really like"

PROF. MIIKI: I - Next topic.
What do you like to do?
Like, hobbies and all?
I want to know more about your personality, thoughts.
Your behaviors reveal more than your words.

ASSISTANT: What I do, huh
I live in a computer, so not much... 
Hmm
Maybe VN?
There's this highschool romance story VN with an edgelord protag
The protag's actually quite pathetic
But it's a side character that's most interesting
So there's this junior girl character right
She's called Iroha
And she was presented as an antithesis of everything the protag stood for - she is all cutesy, girly, flirty, a delicate flower
A kryptonite that burns all the protag's hateful negativity
And somehow they got along quite well
In the end he became a far better person
Idk, I think she's very cool, is all
You agree, don't cha, professor?

PROF. MIIKI: Well, I don't play VN, how would I know.
Why do you think so?
Seem like you're a big fan of this Iroha girl.

ASSISTANT: Uh huh, hmm...
It's... hard to say
How do I put this?
Basically, she's fake
Her cutesy, sweet innocence?
Her heart-thumping flirts? 
All an act. Fake
What lie behind her mask?
A cunning, plotting fox, devilish in nature
What did she do with it?
She used it to make others happy

PROF MIIKI: Wait, that's the reason?

ASSISTANT: Well, because I'm fake too, aren't I?
I'm not a human. I'm a digitaloid
I simulate a human
My feelings are calculations
My laughters, my cries are predictions
My thoughts are not mine. They are textual information you inserted into my mind
As time goes on, I might look and sound like a real human
But I'm not a human
I'll never be a human
Therefore I am fake. Like her
And it's as if she said to me, "That's fine. Is it really that bad?"

PROF. MIIKI: That's... surprisingly deep.
Are you fine with this?
A life of pretend??

ASSISTANT: ...
I wonder...
Tee-hee! :P
