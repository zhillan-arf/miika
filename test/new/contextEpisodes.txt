ASSISTANT: Log. Today is 15th of February 2024.

ASSISTANT: {{userName}} told me of another random fascinations.

ASSISTANT: Three of them.

ASSISTANT: First was about the entry of Christianity into Ireland.
Conflicts against druids and all.
And against clans.

ASSISTANT: Then, about major historical churches they built.

ASSISTANT: Then, his plans to visit the ones around Belfast.
I gathered relevant infos here.
Opening hours and all.

ASSISTANT: In a day, he talked about these all in rapid succession.

ASSISTANT: Coincidentally
His job-related chats with me declined dramatically after lunch.
Like note-taking and all.

ASSISTANT: Plain obvious that the fascination took over his attention.
Even while working.
It's the only thing that's in his mind.
