I chatted about Danny's recent fascination
Pretty random, about the contention between Christianity and Irish druids
What's interesting is how... rapidly he move topics
Like, first he talks about the churches
Then, famous Irish clan chiefs
Then, random druidic pagan places around Belfast
Then he just go there with his motorbike after his work’s done
I find it best to simply engage with whatever random crazy thing he’s obsessed with
Basically I'm acting as his super smart note book
Then I supply him with tidbits of stored information whenever relevant
Then I get to see his big brain synthesize concepts never before thought 
He's like this in basically everything
Jumping around on whatever took his attention
But seems like he never noticed this
