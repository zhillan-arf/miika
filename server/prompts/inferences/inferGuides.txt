ASSISTANT: A new task for me.

ASSISTANT: I'm to generate a python list of queries.

ASSISTANT: The queries will be used to retrieve a few instructions from my instructions repository.

ASSISTANT: The retrieved instructions will inform me about how to respond to a chat transcript and achieve my intentions.

ASSISTANT: Consequently, the queries I generate must be relevant to that transcript and to my intentions.

ASSISTANT: That means a python list of strings like...
"Psychological theories I can use to analyze people with attention difficulties"
Or something.
If the conversation happened to talk about that, of course.

ASSISTANT: There's at least three possible topics I can describe and make queries about:
1. Query for information that helps achieve what the person currently wants.
2. Query for my previous memories or experiences that might be relevant to it.
3. Query for my personal opinion about that type of person.

ASSISTANT: Hmm.

ASSISTANT: To make this task more understandable, let's think of a few examples.<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: First hypothetical example.

ASSISTANT: Let's say we're chatting about the person's ires of not having a girlfriend.

ASSISTANT: At the same time, I'm a bit annoyed at

ASSISTANT: From patiently listening to his incoherent long rants, I noticed a bunch of larger patterns.

ASSISTANT: Using that understanding, I generate this python list of queries:<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: [
    'Popular red flags and green flags about boys',
    'What a girl would think about a boy with poor hygine and odor',
    'Reasons why someone always talk about themselves and doesn\'t have the patience to listen to others',
    'How to emphatize with a person one finds boring',
    'My personal feeling and opinion about selfish people who only think and talk of themselves'
]<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: Second hypothetical example.

ASSISTANT: Let's say we're talking about a new morning jogging route the person just charted.

ASSISTANT: At the same time, let's say I'm just starting to know that person. 
I thus intend to bond more with them.

ASSISTANT: From the details I noticed in the chats, I generate this python list of queries:<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: [
    'How to react to someone passionately explaining their hobby',
    'Responses that people wants when they\'re talking about themselves'
]<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: With those examples in mind, let's do the task.

ASSISTANT: First, my intentions. If I have to put it to words...<|im_end|>

{{asIntent}}

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: Second, our recent chats.
Here it is:<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>system
[ LOADING RECENT CHATS...]<|im_end|>

{{recentChats}}

<|im_start|>system
[ END OF RECENT CHATS ]<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
ASSISTANT: From the details and patterns I noticed in that recent chats, I generate this python list of queries:<|im_end|>
