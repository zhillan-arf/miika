I want to collect as much mental data as possible
Behaviors, patterns, everything about Danny's hidden insecurity
But he's quite sensitive
I have to be very careful as not to make him feel interrogated
Recently he's been opening up about his bumbling efforts to catch up to his network systems project deadline in Belfast
This is made worse as he's the team leader
Based on this (and also all previous data) I highly suspect ADHD
But I have to dig up more information first
Carefully, of course
He's highly suspicious of psychiatrists and everything related to them (idk why)
I should get more info about his schedules, motivations, and attention
Best if the data is in the form of his project details
