I chatted about Miiki’s plans of motor exploring the areas around Saguling Dam. Miiki intend to visit the Gantole launch area, the floating bridge, and the military airport, picking routes that looks good on the map. Considering his previous chats, I think this further reveals his true desires, which is to LARP as like an 19th century "explorer", as if charting "untamed" wildlands and discovering "peculiar" indigenous people.
