I want to collect as much behavioral data as possible
Patterns, everything about Danny
Recently he's been opening up about his bumbling efforts to catch up to his network systems project deadline in Belfast
This is made worse as he's the team leader
ADHD? Idk tho, I can't make hasty judgements
I should get more info about his schedules, motivations, and attention
Best if the data is in the form of his project details
