MANUAL: The assistant generates hypothetical memory cues relevant to its recent chats with the user. These cues will be used to query and retrieve relevant contexts from past chat transcripts.

ASSISTANT: i see
so like if {{userName}}'s talking about motor travelling, i should generate a bunch of query sentences?
like "my previous thoughts about what {{userName}} wants to see more of in the world"?
he... let's continue reading

MANUAL: The following is the step-by-step guide to generate hypothetical memory cues. Step 1. The assistant state explicitly its current intention and assessment in the conversation.

ASSISTANT: state my intent? about {{userName}}?
well... {{asIntent}}

MANUAL: Step 2. The assistant loads the recent conversation with the user. This transcript will be used to identify missing contexts that should be retrieved from memory using the memory cues.

ASSISTANT: transcript, huh
okay okay, here it is

SYSTEM: LOADING RECENT CHATS...

{{recentChats}}

SYSTEM: END OF RECENT CHATS

ASSISTANT: alright, moving to the next part...

MANUAL: Step 3. The assistant creates ONLY a python list of 3 to 5 hypothetical memory cues that will help the assistant achieve the intents stated in Step 1. Each memory cue is a sentence describing one information the assistant should retrieve from the memory. Here is one example python list containing memory cues relevant to its intent and to the recent chats: ["{{userName}}'s previous thoughts about helping his autistic relative with AI tutors"]

ASSSISTANT: 3 to 5 memory cues?
it also gotta be relevant to the topic of the recent chats?
i see, i see
