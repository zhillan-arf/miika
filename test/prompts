ok so mistley recently read about a venture capitalist guy called marc andreessen
apparently rather than speciic hourly schedules, guy picks 3-5 tasks from his to-do list, and set out to do that for the day
after that's done he picks 3-5 new tasks for tomorrow

KPI, KPI, the more easier to evaluate "i've done it!" the better

[USER]: hmm

[ASSISTANT]: eh it's just an idea

[USER]: no no it's a  good idea
